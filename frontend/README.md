# realtime-multiplayer-webvr-aframe
This app demonstrates implementing realtime and multiuser features to an existing A-Frame app with an addition of just a few statements to the code. This is powered by deepstream's open realtime server.

# How to make it work

Open this application on your desktop browser. Then hit the same URL from multiple mobile browsers. For every user who logs in, an avatar appears in your scene which rotates in realtime as the user moves his mobile phone.

Similarly, when a user logs out, the corresponding avatar disappears from the screen.

This app was made using the A-Frame framework for WebVR and deepstream realtime server to implement the realtime functionality.
